fd-el-get.el
============
Use fd-el-get.el to get packages. Note that I should only get the packages that I absolutely need. If I get the whole list, it will take forever. 
=> should look into naquadah-theme to get cool colors
=> should also get a package for LaTeX

fd-visual.el
===========
This file contains everything needed to make emacs look cool. Note that you can change font and that the color of comments are pink, but I should probably change that.
